# 🚑 MITM-Based GPS Spoofing on Ambulance Systems

A cybersecurity research project demonstrating how **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks** can be used to **spoof GPS data** in an ambulance navigation system, highlighting the real-world risks of insecure communication in critical services.

## ⚠️ Problem Statement

Modern emergency services heavily rely on GPS-based navigation systems. If these systems are compromised, attackers could manipulate location data, mislead vehicles, delay emergency response, and potentially endanger lives.

This project simulates how a MITM attack can be used to spoof GPS coordinates and redirect an ambulance system.

## 🎯 Objective

- To demonstrate GPS spoofing using MITM techniques  
- To analyze security risks in navigation-based systems  
- To understand real-world attack vectors on IoT and vehicle networks  
- To promote the importance of secure communication in critical infrastructure  

---

## 🧠 How the System Works

- Attacker sets up a **Man-in-the-Middle environment**
- Intercepts GPS/location data
- Modifies coordinates in real time
- Sends spoofed data to the navigation system
- The system displays a **false location / route**
